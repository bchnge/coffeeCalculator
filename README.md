# coffeeCalculator
## Learn SwiftUI and Improve My Coffee!
 
This application is my first test at developing using SwiftUI. The goal is to make a simple calculator that determines proper coffee dosage and water distribution based on certain user-defined parameters (total serving size, preferred coffee strength, and acidity). These parameters determine the amount of water to be poured as suggested by Tetsu Kasuya's award-winning 4:6 pour-over method, which tunes sweetness and strength based on the amount of water poured in succession.

## Roadmap
- Incorporate a SQL backend for recording settings and brews
- Add rating system
- Add QR Scanner for tracking specific beans and bean profiles
